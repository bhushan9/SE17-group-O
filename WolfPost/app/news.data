VConan Exiles is the latest, and well, it\u2019s certainly early.\u000aThey\u2019re like, well, the rinky dink first items you assemble from grass, shit, and dreams in a survival game.\u000aI\u2019ve seen a handful of people try desperately to anoint it the de facto Ark: Survival Evolved killer.\u000aBest video game turtle since that one I accidentally punched to death at the start of Crysis.\u000aSo far, Conan definitely reminds me of Ark, but Ark is much further along these days.
