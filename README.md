##Project Overview:

The aim of the project is to bring out our own solutions in providing summarized news. We would like to reduce the issues faced by readers while reading the news from websites, like disturbing images, light intensity,etc. The project kicked off by conducting extensive user surveys to understand the problems faced by the readers. As we where talking about digital news, we restricted our sample population to students who would require digital news in short, and simple. According to the survey we designed our three solutions.

##Solution1: Web Application

We designed a Web Application that allows the users to create accounts and read news. It was developed in [Python Flask Web application framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/). It is located in the **WolfPost** folder. It is in the process of development. It will be also combined with a Twitter API, that could post the summarized news as tweets.

##Solution2: Text-to-Speech News summarizer

The second method was to provide an audio interface that could produce the news as computer generated speech. We are currently using a Javascript library to acomplish this.

##Solution3: Twitter Bot

Social media has become a media gateway for younger internet users. In order to explore this market, we will be distributing short news summaries using Twitter. The current Twitter page can be found under the username [WolfpackPost](https://twitter.com/WolfpackPost).
