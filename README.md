##Project Overview:

The aim of the project is to bring out our own solutions in providing summarized news. We would like to reduce the issues faced by
readers while reading the news from websites, like disturbing images, light intensity,etc. The project kicked off by conducting extensive user surveys
to understand the problems faced by the readers. As we where talking about digital news, we restricted our sample population to students
who would require digital news in short, and simple. According to the survey we designed our three solutions.

##Solution1: Web Application

We designed a Web Application that allows the users to create accounts and read news. It was developed in 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Python Flask Web application framework</a>. It is located in the **WolfPost** folder. It is in the 
process of development. It will be also combined with a Twitter API, that could post the summarized news as tweets.

##Solution2: Text-to-Speech News summarizer

The second method was to provide an audio interface that could produce the news as media file. It is in development.

##Solution3: Text Message/Email

Sending news via email or text message. This will be done using a server intermediated by a javascript code. It is in the process of
development.
